# Setting up Formbricks SDK with Next.js App Directory

This guide will walk you through the process of integrating the Formbricks SDK into a Next.js application using the new app directory. As the Formbricks SDK only works on the client side, it's essential to ensure proper integration to avoid any issues.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

1. A Next.js application set up and running.
2. A Formbricks account with access to your environment ID and API host. You can find these in the **Setup Checklist** in the Settings:

## 1. Installing Formbricks SDK

First, you need to install the Formbricks SDK using one of the following commands:

<CodeGroup title="Install Formbricks">

```sh {{ title: 'npm' }}
npm install --save @formbricks/js
```

```sh {{ title: 'pnpm' }}
pnpm add @formbricks/js
```

```sh {{ title: 'yarn' }}
yarn add @formbricks/js
```

</CodeGroup>

## 2. Integrating with Next.js 13 App Directory

The Next.js 13 app directory requires us to initialize Formbricks differently than the pages directory. Specifically, the app directory server-side renders components by default, and the formbricks-js library is a client-side library. To make these work together, create a `formbricks.tsx` file (or `formbricks.js` if you don't use Typescript) and set up the FormbricksProvider with the 'use client' directive:

<CodeGroup title="Integrating Formbricks: app/formbricks.tsx">

```tsx {{ title: 'app/formbricks.tsx' }}
"use client";
import formbricks from "@formbricks/js";
import { usePathname, useSearchParams } from "next/navigation";
import { useEffect } from "react";

export default function FormbricksProvider() {
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();

  useEffect(() => {
    formbricks.init({
      environmentId: "clj66eqzu00m5qu0g8leglrns",
      apiHost: "https://app.formbricks.com", // e.g. https://app.formbricks.com
      debug: true, // remove when in production
    });
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    formbricks?.registerRouteChange();
  }, [pathname, searchParams]);

  return null;
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Once we do this, we can then import the `formbricks.tsx` file in our `app/layout.tsx` file, and wrap our app in the Formbricks provider.

<CodeGroup title="Integrating Formbricks: app/layout.tsx">

```tsx
import FormbricksProvider from "./formbricks";
import "./globals.css";

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <FormbricksProvider />
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## 3. Validate your setup

Once you have completed the steps above, you can validate your setup by checking the **Setup Checklist** in the Settings. Your widget status indicator should go from this:

<Image
  src={WidgetNotConnected}
  alt="Widget isnt connected"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

To this:

<Image
  src={WidgetConnected}
  alt="Widget is connected"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>
